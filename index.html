          Hi There,
          <div class="heading-line">
            I'm <span class="accent-2">Prince Thind</span>.
          </div>
        </h1>
        <p class="intro-para para">
          Many people know me only as
          <span class="accent-1">"The Tech Guy"</span>, but I am also a little
          more than that. I have a variety of interests and like to identify as
          an <span class="accent-1">outgoing introvert</span>. I come from
          Ludhiana, the largest city north of New Delhi. I am a native Punjabi
          speaker but communicate more effectively with others in Hindi or
          English.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="heading accent-1">Education</h2>
      <p class="para">
        I am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science
        <span class="accent-1">(B.tech CSE Hons.)</span> from
        <a href="https://www.lpu.in" class="link">LPU</a>, one of the largest
        universities in India. Throughout my academic journey I have maintained
        an excellent academic record, yet sometimes I find myself lost in the
        bigger picture. To say that I am not a fan of formal education is bit of
        an understatement.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading accent-1">Career</h2>
      <p class="para">
        Since I am still a student, I am not working yet. However, I have full
        confidence in my abilites and skills. Professionally, I identify as a
        competent
        <span class="accent-1"> web developer</span>. I work with a myriad of
        technologies and have over 40+ projects under my belt. if you are
        interested, I invite you to checkout my professional
        <a href="https://prince-thind.github.io" class="link">portfolio</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading accent-1">Interests</h2>
      <p class="para">
        I have a wide variety of interests in life. I love to explore things
        that are deep and sometimes eccentric in nature. Subjects which involve
        study and analysis of things such as
        <span class="accent-1">history </span> never fail to fascinate me. I
        enjoy reading and watching documentaries based on world war 2.
        <span class="accent-1">Games</span> that feature rather deep mechanics
        and a steep learning curve such as
        <a
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/"
          class="link"
          >Rimworld</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/"
          class="link"
          >Dwarf Fortress</a
        >
        and
        <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft"
          >Minecraft</a
        >
        are my favourite.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        <span class="accent-1">Cooking and gardening</span> are some of the
        other interests of mine. Lastly, I have a deep love for the
        <span class="accent-1">English Language</span>. I am always intrigued by
        subtleties of this beautiful language. I am naturally drawn towards
        aspects of English that are explored seldom by others.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading accent-1">Introversion</h2>
      <p class="para">
        My friends often describe me as being somewhat eccentric or awkward, but
        I choose to believe they use that as an alias for introversion. My
        personality of an
        <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality" class="link"
          >ISTJ</a
        >
        is something that has heavily influenced my life. I find it rather
        unpleasant that society, at large, refuses to acknowledge the
        differences between <span class="accent-1">"shyness"</span> and
        <span class="accent-1">"introversion"</span>. I wish society could
        embrace introverted people but alas. Here's a helpful
        <a
          href="https://themindsjournal.com/how-to-care-for-an-introvert/"
          class="link"
          >graphic</a
        >
        that summarizes introverted behaviour and preferences.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading accent-1">Perspective about life</h2>
      <p class="para">
        I strongly value <span class="accent-1">liberty</span> in life. Be it
        software(open source initiative) or one's personal life, I am one of
        those who take liberty very seriously. Unsurprisngly, my personal values
        in life are very liberal. I am heavily influenced by the theory of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism" class="link"
          >utilitarianism</a
        >. I believe that a
        <span class="accent-1">benevolent attitude</span> towards life is
        necessary for a fulfilling life.
      </p>
