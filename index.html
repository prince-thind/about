                Hi There, I'm <span class="accent-2">Prince Thind</span>.

            <p class="para">
                Many people know me only as <span class="accent-1"> 'The Tech Guy'</span>, but I am also a little more
                than that.
                I have a variety of interests and like to identify as an <span class="accent-1">Outgoing
                    Introvert</span>.
                I come from the largest Indian city north of New Delhi - Ludhiana. I am a native Punjabi speaker
                but resonate better with others in Hindi or English.

            Education
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science Honours <span class="accent-1">(B.tech CSE Hons.)</span> from
            <a href="https://www.lpu.in" class="link">LPU</a>. Throughout
            my academic journey I have maintained an excellent academic record, yet sometimes I find myself
            lost in the bigger picture. To say that I am not a fan of formal education is bit of an understatement.

            Career
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I am not working yet and I am tired of many telling me that I am wasting my potential by not joining a
            student internship or something. The only reason I have chosen not to deliberately enter the corporal world
            is the fulfillment my academic duties. I have full confidence in my abilites and skills. Professionally, I
            identify as a skilled <span class="accent-1"> web developer</span>. I work with a myriad of technologies and
            have over 40+ projects under
            my belt. if you are interested, I invite you to checkout my <a href="https://prince-thind.github.io"

            Interests
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I have a wide variety of interests in life. I love to explore
            things that are deep and sometimes eccentric in nature. Subjects which involve study and analysis of things
            such as <span class="accent-1">history </span> make up the bulk of my interests. I enjoy reading and
            watching documentaries based on world
            war 2. <span class="accent-1">Games</span> that feature rather deep mechanics and a steep learning curve
            such as: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/" class="link">Rimworld</a>, <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" class="link">Dwarf Fortress</a> and <a
                class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> are my favourite.

        </p>
        <p class="para">
            <span class="accent-1">Cooking and gardening</span> are some of the other interests of mine. And ofcourse
            <span class="accent-1">Technology</span> in general never
            fails to get my attention. Lastly, I have a deep love for the <span class="accent-1">English
                Language</span>. I enjoy learning the
            intricacies and subtleties of this beautiful language. I am naturally drawn towards the aspects of this
            wonderful language that are explored seldom by others.

            Introversion
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            My friends often describe me as being somewhat eccentric or awkward, but I choose to believe they use
            that as an alias for introversion. My personality of an <a
                href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality" class="link">ISTJ</a> is something that has
            heavily influenced my life. I find it rather unpleasant that
            society at large refuses to acknowledge the differences between <span class="accent-1">'shyness'</span> and
            <span class="accent-1">'introversion'</span>. I find <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder#/media/File:20220801_Introversion_-_Shyness_-_Social_anxiety_disorder_-_comparative_chart.svg"
                class="link">this</a>
            graphic helpful for people who find the terms confusion. At it's core, introversion has got to do with
            'preference' and 'time' spent socializing, here's another cool <a
                href="https://themindsjournal.com/how-to-care-for-an-introvert/" class="link">graphic</a>
            that summarizes introverted behaviour and preferences.

        <h2 class="sub-heading accent-1">
            Perspective about life
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            For a significant part of my academic life, I used to be a <span class="accent-1"> narcisstic person</span>.
            But I have since grown up
            to be a better person. I now advocate <span class="accent-1">good morals</span> in life as the driving force
            of a fulfilling life.
            It may sound strange, but my personal life is driven by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism"
                class="link">hedonistic</a>
            Approach, which explains why I have a strong aversion towards primtive customs. Lastly, more than anything
            else, I value <span class="accent-1">liberty</span> in life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading accent-1">
            Politics and Religion
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I have a negative interest in politics. This is largely due to the extremely corrupt atmosphere that
            surrounds it. I like to refrain from any political discussions and I am of the firm opinion that those who
            occupy themselves too much into political arguements could do a lot better in life if they chose to do
            something productive for themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            My religous views are very complicated. I generally do not like to disclose my views on religion.
            I am a theist but prefer to talk about religion comfortably only with my close friends.
