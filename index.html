            Hi There, I'm <span class="accent-2">Prince Thind</span>.
        </h1>
        <p class="para">
            Many people know me only as 'the tech guy', but I am also a little more than that.
            I have a variety of interests and like to identify as an outgoing Introvert.
            I come from the largest Indian city north of New Delhi - Ludhiana. I am a native Punjabi speaker
            but resonate better with others in Hindi or English.

            Education
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science Honours (B.tech CSE Hons.) from
            <a href="https://www.lpu.in" class="link">LPU</a>. Throughout
            my academic journey I have maintained an excellent academic record, yet sometimes I find myself
            lost in the bigger picture. To say that I am not a fan of formal education is bit of an understatement.

            Career
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I am not working yet and I am tired of many telling me that I am wasting my potential by not joining a
            student internship or something. The only reason I have chosen not to deliberately enter the corporal world
            is the fulfillment my academic duties. I have full confidence in my abilites and skills. Professionally, I
            identify as a skilled web developer. I work with a myriad of technologies and have over 40+ projects under
            my belt. if you are interested, I invite you to checkout my <a href="https://prince-thind.github.io"

            Interests
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I have a wide variety of interests in life. I love to explore
            things that are deep and sometimes eccentric in nature. Subjects which involve study and analysis of things
            such as history make up the bulk of my interests. I enjoy reading and watching documentaries based on world
            war 2. Games that feature rather deep mechanics and a steep learning curve such as: <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/" class="link">Rimworld</a>, <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" class="link">Dwarf Fortress</a> and <a
                class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> are my favourite.

        </p>
        <p class="para">
            Cooking and gardening are some of the other interests of mine. And ofcourse Technology in general never
            fails to get my attention. Lastly, I have a deep love for the English Language. I enjoy learning the
            intricacies and subtleties of this beautiful language. I am naturally drawn towards the aspects of this
            wonderful language that are explored seldom by others.
        </p>

            Introversion
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I am often described by my friends as being somewhat eccentric or awkward, but I choose to believe they use
            that as an alias for introversion. My personality of an <a
                href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality" class="link">ISTJ</a> is something that has
            heavily influenced my life. I find it rather unpleasant that
            society at large refuses to acknowledge the differences between 'shyness' and 'introversion'. I find <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder#/media/File:20220801_Introversion_-_Shyness_-_Social_anxiety_disorder_-_comparative_chart.svg" class="link">this</a>
            graphic helpful for people who find the terms confusion. At it's core, introversion has got to do with
            'preference' and 'time' spent socializing, here's another cool <a
                href="https://themindsjournal.com/how-to-care-for-an-introvert/" class="link">graphic</a>
            that summarizes introverted behaviour and preferences.

        <h2 class="sub-heading accent-1">
            Perspective about life
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            For a significant part of my academic life, I used to be a narcisstic person. But I have since grown up
            to be a better person. I now advocate good morals in life as the driving force of a fulfilling life.
            It may sound strange, but my personal life is driven by a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism" class="link">Hedonistic</a>
            Approach, which explains why I have a strong aversion towards primtive customs. Latly, more than anything
            else, I value liberty in life.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading accent-1">
            Politics and Religion
        </h2>
        <p class="para">
            I have a negative interest in politics. This is largely due to the extremely corrupt atmosphere that
            surrounds it. I like to refrain from any political discussions and I am of the firm opinion that those who
            occupy themselves too much into political arguements could do a lot better in life if they chose to do
            something productive for the economy.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
            My religous views are very complicated. I come from a society of the bacground of this <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravidassia" class="link">religion</a>. I have some background of Christianity in
            my family roots too and it is probably the religion that has influenced me the most. My personal views align
            more with that of Christianity than any other.
